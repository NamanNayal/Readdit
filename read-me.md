  - create index.js, a starting point for our backend

 - npm install mongoose in root, create a mongodb cluster, mongoose for smooth interation btw nodejs and mongodb, set up a .env and include it in gitignore, .env for URI.
 -npm i dontenv for a zero-dependency module to load environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
